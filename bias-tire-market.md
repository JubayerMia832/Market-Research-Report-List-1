<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bias Tire Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>General Bias Tire</li><li>Bias Belted Tire</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The bias tire market consists of two main types: general bias tires and bias belted tires. General bias tires are constructed with layers of fabric cords running diagonally, providing durability and a smooth ride, but typically have lower load capacities. In contrast, bias belted tires incorporate additional belts of steel or similar materials beneath the tread, enhancing stability, performance, and load-bearing abilities, while still maintaining the bias ply design's flexibility. Both types are suited for specific applications and vehicle requirements.</p></p>
