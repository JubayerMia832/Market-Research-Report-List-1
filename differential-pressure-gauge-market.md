<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Differential Pressure Gauge Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Piston</li><li>Diaphragm</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The differential pressure gauge market is primarily segmented into two types: piston and diaphragm gauges. Piston gauges utilize a movable piston to measure pressure differences, providing accurate readings in various industrial applications. Diaphragm gauges, on the other hand, use a flexible diaphragm that deflects under pressure changes, offering sensitivity and reliability, especially in low-pressure environments. Each type serves distinct needs, with piston gauges often used in high-pressure settings, while diaphragm gauges excel in managing corrosive or viscous fluids.</p></p>
