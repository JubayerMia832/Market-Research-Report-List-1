<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Blown Optical Fiber Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydraulically Powered</li><li>Pneumatically Powered</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Blown optical fiber systems utilize two primary power sources: hydraulically powered and pneumatically powered systems. Hydraulically powered systems rely on high-pressure fluid to install fiber cables into pre-installed ducts, providing enhanced control and speed. Conversely, pneumatically powered systems use compressed air to blow the fibers into the ducts, allowing for quick and efficient deployment over long distances. Both types optimize fiber installation, reduce labor costs, and enhance accessibility for future network expansions in telecommunication projects.</p></p>
