<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ventilated Seats Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Fans Seats</li><li>Axial Fans Seats</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The ventilated seats market comprises two primary types: radial fan seats and axial fan seats. Radial fan seats utilize a fan design that draws air in and expels it radially, providing effective cooling and airflow. This design is often favored for its compactness and efficiency in confined spaces. In contrast, axial fan seats employ a fan that moves air parallel to the fan's shaft, offering a more directional airflow. Both types enhance occupant comfort by reducing heat and moisture in vehicles.</p></p>
