<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biosolids Management Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Aerobic Digestion</li><li>Anaerobic Digestion</li><li>Nutrient Removal or Recovery</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Biosolids management involves various treatment processes to handle sewage sludge. Aerobic digestion employs oxygen to decompose organic material, producing stabilized biosolids suitable for land application. Anaerobic digestion, on the other hand, occurs in the absence of oxygen, generating biogas as a renewable energy source while stabilizing the sludge. Nutrient removal or recovery focuses on extracting valuable nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus from wastewater, promoting recycling and minimizing environmental impacts. These approaches enhance sustainability and resource recovery in biosolid management.</p></p>
