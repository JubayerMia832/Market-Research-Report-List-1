<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pneumatic Damper Actuators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spring Return Damper Actuators</li><li>Non-Spring Return Damper Actuators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The pneumatic damper actuators market is divided into two primary types: spring return and non-spring return damper actuators. Spring return dampers utilize a spring mechanism to return to a default position when not pressurized, providing a fail-safe option in emergencies. In contrast, non-spring return dampers depend solely on pneumatic pressure to operate, allowing for precise control but lacking automatic return features. Both types are essential in controlling airflow and enhancing energy efficiency in HVAC systems and industrial applications.</p></p>
