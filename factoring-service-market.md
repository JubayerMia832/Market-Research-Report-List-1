<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Factoring Service Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Recourse</li><li>Non-recourse</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The factoring service market can be split into two main types: recourse and non-recourse. In a recourse factoring arrangement, the seller retains the risk of non-payment and must buy back the invoice if the customer defaults. Conversely, non-recourse factoring transfers the risk of non-payment to the factor, who absorbs the loss if the customer fails to pay. This provides sellers with a greater sense of security but often comes at a higher cost compared to recourse arrangements.</p></p>
