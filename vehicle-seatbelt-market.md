<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vehicle Seatbelt Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive</li><li>Active</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The vehicle seatbelt market can be categorized into two types: passive and active. Passive seatbelt systems automatically secure occupants upon vehicle movement, relying on the car's built-in mechanisms for deployment. In contrast, active seatbelt systems are designed to engage dynamically, adjusting tension during sudden stops or collisions to provide enhanced protection. Both types serve critical roles in occupant safety, but their operational methodologies differ, with passive systems focusing on readiness, while active systems actively respond to driving conditions.</p></p>
